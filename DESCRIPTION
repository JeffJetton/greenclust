Description: Implements a method of iteratively collapsing the rows of a
    contingency table, two at a time, by selecting the pair of categories whose
    combination results in a new table with the smallest loss of chi-squared.
    The result is an extended version of the hclust object used in the stats
    package and can be used similarly (plotted as a dendrogram, cut, etc.).
    Additional functions are provided in the package for automatic cutting and
    diagnostic plotting.
